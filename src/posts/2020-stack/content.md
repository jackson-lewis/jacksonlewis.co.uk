Some of the very first lines of code from Shiftr actually started back in early 2018 in a final year university project I dubbed “Project Dawn”. It was my first proper web project, the initial foundation to my stack as I entered my professional career. This wasn’t actually a WordPress theme, kinda like a toolkit, more than a css framework but less than a theme.

Early 2019 saw the transition of Project Dawn to a WordPress theme. This was a big deal as I had never built a theme from scratch, and to be honest, there were many core fundamentals to a theme which I didn’t have any knowledge on, such as setting up `add_theme_support()`. Along with a big change, it was only right that the project was rebranded, so born was “Shape Shiftr”, or Shiftr for short. As of today (June 2020), the theme is still actively maintained, we’re about to release v1.2 this week.

2020 hasn’t exactly been a quiet year. I was furloughed for 2 months in fact, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where I suddenly had all the time in the world without having to worry about finances. I didn’t waste this time, I saw an opportunity to explore all the new technologies I’d been wanting to try out for months and months. The single biggest change I am edging towards is JavaScript, and more specifically, React. It’s a whole new world to the WordPress stack I’d become used to. Sceptical at first, however once I understand why React is so great, it all made sense. However, I began to struggle mentally. Yes, this has taken a sharp left turn.

This WordPress stack I was so used to, I suddenly felt like I missed a turn in the road, and that the world was accelerating down a new route of these JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. And a began to discover more, and more, and more. It was very overwhelming.

## Moving forward
What I have decided is that I am going to slowly transition myself, as a developer, over to this newer, modern era of web development. I have accepted it is not going to happen overnight, rather a minimum of at least 6 months to a year. I have become fairly protective over what I decide to learn going forward, anything JavaScript is an absolute yes, whereas with SQL I am likely to turn a blind eye.

Going down this route isn’t to say I am just to throw away everything I’ve learnt so far, far from it. In fact, much of it is transferable, luckily.

Shiftr will always remain available on GitHub as a testament to these initial years of my career. My plan is to extract where I can from Shiftr and use in a new project.

The new project, it’ll be Shiftr, but for React. There will be a rebrand, again, however this will be a monumental step up. I aim to really set myself out with this, and to develop a real solid foundation in this modern era. I am toying over Gatsby.js and Next.js, I understand the use-cases behind each but would like to gravitate towards one of them. Heck, maybe we’ll have two versions of the project, one for Gatsby and the other for Next. Not sure how manageable that will be, let’s see.

### The future is a scary thing
I am super excited to begin on my journey to React, more specifically getting really in-depth with both Gatsby and Next. I’ve also explored the wp-graphql, for working with a headless instance of WordPress. I am extra excited for when I publish my first ever proper client site build with one of these frameworks, deployed with either Netlify or Vercel. I’ve already tried both, and both are very, very good. Vercel has had a phenomenal amount of funding raised and that really shows in the platform. The pair are both super easy to use, it’s kinda scary just how simple it really is to work with. I’ve had my portfolio (built with Gatsby) site hosted on Netlify since June 2020.
