        <h3>brief</h3>
        <p>Over the past few years, the term web designer and web developer have been used interchangeably, as the responsibilities they entail can vary greatly. So a web designer will be required to design and/or prototype a site, probably with either Adobe XD or Sketch before any code is written. When the client feels happy with the design meeting all requirements, the designer can then build the site. Meaning designers now-a-days are more or less excepted to have technical skills of at least HTML/CSS alongside their non-technical design experience.</p>
