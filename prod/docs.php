            <h2>research of industry</h2>
            <p>5 years have passed since discovering the world of web design back in high school using Adobe Dreamweaver CS3. From creating static web pages using tables to producing complex dynamic pages using the likes of Scss, JavaScript and back-end technologies PHP and mySQL. Even before discovering this industry, I was always a creative and artist personality, but as the years went on I ditched the paintbrush in favour of learning CSS to make great looking websites. Moving through college I quickly learned how much I cared about the overall quality of the design, aligning content as well as possible. In the past year of 2017, the technical side of my skillset has rocketed faster than ever before, learning PHP changed everything, and I’ve moved to writing in Scss, and haven’t touched vanilla CSS ever since.<br><br>So, I’ve always been one to pay serious attention to the quality of design, and at the same time master the technical skills required to make the final product stand out amongst the rest.<br><br>Because of this, I’m more of a jack of all trades, so I could be a designer and/or developer. I would say I care more about the design, as that’s what gives me the most motivation to see a project through to the end, always making it better. Having a rather varied skillset presents myself with more opportunities in the future, being about to focus on design on one project, but then JavaScript on another.<br><br>For the purpose of this documentation, I will label myself as a designer.<br><br>This chapter will provide insight into the life as a web designer, there are also additional references to a freelance designer where relevant. I read the job profile on prospects.ac.uk and other sources listed.</p>

            <h3>role</h3>
            <p>Over the past few years, the term web designer and web developer have been used interchangeably, as the responsibilities they entail can vary greatly. So a web designer will be required to design and/or prototype a site, probably with either Adobe XD or Sketch before any code is written. When the client feels happy with the design meeting all requirements, the designer can then build the site. Meaning designers now-a-days are more or less excepted to have technical skills of at least HTML/CSS alongside their non-technical design experience.<br><br>Another crucial change to the way sites are designed is the growth of mobile and other portable devices, all with different screen sizes and aspect ratios. It’s considered good practise to design from the smallest (mobile) and work up through tablet devices and then completing the final designs for larger displays (desktop). Even more recently, depending on the requirements and intended purpose of the project, sites may need to be designed for smart TV’s, with most screen sizes between 40 to 65” and above.</p>

            <h3>responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As mentioned before, what a web designer gets up to on a daily basis will vary on the business, and even a specific project at hand.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="assets/docs/images/responsibilities.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>Here are a handful of responsibilities a designer may face:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial meetings clients to identify needs of a project and regular updates</li>
                <li>Producing detailed project specifications</li>
                <li>Designing sample page layouts (before whole site is designed)</li>
                <li>Creating necessary graphic elements such as icons, editing images</li>
                <li>Development using HTML/CSS and possibly JavaScript</li>
                <li>Working on CMS’ (Content management systems)</li>
                <li>Search engine optimisation</li>
                <li>Testing website before client handover</li>
                <li>Working with web developers producing back-end aspects of a project</li>

            <h3>skillset</h3>
            <p>The industry in constantly on the move, blink and there’s something new on the block. There in no training period then you just get on with it like most jobs. As a web designer you never stop learning and discovering, be it a new library or framework, a new best practice, or even a new language! Likewise, the list of skills possessed by a designer will always grow with time.</p>
            <h4>You big softy: The soft skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Nothing out of the ordinary, but ones to note include: attention to detail, creativity, teamwork, leading said team, problem solving, presenting, self-learning, communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The technical ones:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking at software for design stages - primary tools will be Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator. It may also be possible to see Adobe Animate and Indesign on this list also. Oddly enough, you won’t see Adobe Dreamweaver on the list anymore, times have changed. Even in my experience I have stopped using it, an application I loved and never wanted to stop using… but here we are.</li>
                <li>In development, front-end will consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Today, it’s unlikely to find a job where you won’t be expected to use a CSS pre-processor such as Sass or Less. It’s also a good idea to be equipped with jQuery, the #1 JavaScript library ever.</li>
                <li>Many jobs may also have a CMS in the requirements or desirable skills. Most of the time it will be Wordpress, but could also see Drupal or Joomla. This starts entering the realms of back-end language PHP, which would be a bonus and a half. Although you won’t be expected to know any, probably.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More of a trait than an actual skill, but having real passion and enthusiasm for the industry and what you do will get you a long way. Hopefully.</p>

            <p>A common trend is found that designers and developers fall into one of three main stages in their career.</p>

Unsurprising, the highest salaries are found in London.<br><br>There are tons of sites listing salaries, so this is fairly average take on all those sites. Again, the location will play a big part in the pay check, something to be wary of when looking.<br><br>Not only do the majority of jobs offer a tasty salary, but also include some good benefits, a selection could include: pension schemes, parking, life assurance, you may be lucky to have half-day Fridays, staff discounts if with a retail company, or even a company car if you work for a car manufacturer like VM in Milton Keynes…</p>

            <h3>working hours</h3>
            <p>As with most, expect a Monday to Friday 9 til 5. However, this can vary depending on the workload at the time. Some places also only work half the day on Friday before heading off to the pub. As you only need a trusty computer and Internet that isn’t shit, it’s easy to work overtime, even from home if required. This obviously makes being a freelance very easy, as the job can be done remotely almost anywhere, anywhere there’s Wifi of course.</p>

            <h4>adobe indesign</h4>
            <p>The first part of the project saw the development of the CV, accompanying cover letter and the business card. My previous CV’s had been created using the application so I was confident in being able to produce a design I was satisfied with. I particularly made use of margins and columns, and use of the typography tools aided with creating a perfected aligned design.</p>
            <h4>adobe XD</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html" target="_blank">What is XD?</a><br><br>With previous experience creating wireframes and designs with this new application, I knew there would be no issue creating a design I would be proud of. Spacing and alignment is crucial for my brand, so XD’s handy margins and layout feature were of great use.</p>
            <h4>adobe illustrator</h4>
            <p>The only true option when it comes to creating logos. With a logo already created, it was a mater of refinement using the direct tool to adjust the elements of the branding assets.</p>
            <h4>adobe photoshop</h4>
            <p>The role of this application was to crop images to size and remove unwanted areas from screenshots and optimise images ready for site publishing.</p>

            <h2>cv <!-- &amp; cover letter --></h2>
            <p>Before embarking on this re-brand project, I had 3 creative CV’s. I had a 3-column design, and then made a move to a 2-column layout, before this project saw me head back to 3-columns. Shown here, the most recent CV using 2 columns, which I was happy with but it still had issues I wanted to resolve in this latest version.</p>

            <h3>cv</h3>
            <p>I started with some research on CV’s, what their purpose is and what should and shouldn’t be included. I discovered many interesting ideas which have been brought into the final design, including the idea of disregarding any grades in education. The most important focus on this re-design was to squeeze everything onto just one page. This involved sacrificing a section labelled other skills, removing icons on interests, reducing contact details, and an overhaul of the written content throughout.<br><br>This article from Smashing Magazine - <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/10-handy-tips-for-web-design-cvs-and-resumes/" target="_blank">How To Create A Great Web Designer Résumé and CV?</a> talks about conveying style and personality into the design of the CV, and how those design decisions can affect the type of company you are looking to work for.</p>
            <p><b>Some other key pointers from the article:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it all short and snappy, this also allows more to talk about in the interview. It’s also a good idea leaving some details out, especially anything that is irrelevant or doesn’t add anything to the CV.</li>
                <li>Wez Maynard offers some great advice regarding grades:
                    <blockquote>
                        “If the employer wants to judge you on your grades and not your portfolio, believe me, you do not want to work for them.”
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>Don’t overdo the design, keep it simple. But don’t be boring…</li>
                <li>Make it perfect, and use a grid. Everything should be pixel perfect and alignment both horizontally and vertically should be impeccable.</li>
                <li>The CV should also be print friendly; so making sure it’s A4, white background, works in black and white and will retain text and image quality at 300dpi, with fonts embedded into PDF file.</li>
                <li>It’s important to show your own style, which as a designer you should have. This doesn’t have to just be with the actual design, it can use of humour or style of language.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="assets/docs/cv/research.jpg">
            </div>
            <p> I set out some guidelines I wanted to follow based off some of the research and my own preferences. This included a less is more approach and improving how quickly the CV could be scanned by an employer. The layout is very precise and strictly followed, along with consistency of how titles and subtitles such as positions and dates are displayed.</p>
            <p>I duplicated my old CV indesign file and reset the margins and set 3 columns. The move to 3 columns while reducing the volume of text was immediately going to require immense thought. I made rough sketches of how I anticipated the layout should look, and then set about matching this layout digitally.</p>
            <p><b>Here's how I expected to layout the CV:</b></p>
            <p>For the header, the logo would always remain in the upper left, set to the width of one column, with contact details underneath. The profile statement would span two columns alongside the contact details, with good spacing above and below to improve readability.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="assets/docs/cv/cv@first-draft.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>As for the sections, I settled for experience, skillset, education, employment and interests. All sections span the full width of the document, with the exception of education which spans two, with employment adjacent at one column width.<br><br>I defined the section headings, at one column width, with a separating line underneath.<br><br>The vertical spacing between in the sections is also equal.<br><br>Once I had my first drafted completed, I decided to create a sample version that was landscape, as shown here.

            <p>Alongside the CV, I thought it would help to have a covering letter that matched the newly designed CV. The logo remained in the same position, with main body text spanning the full width. I experimented with narrower widths for the main body, with the expectation of reducing the number of characters per line but allowing a high enough word count.<br><br>I found a real job advert on totaljobs.com that required a covering letter and used this to produce a first mock-up version from which future letters could be created.</p>

            <h2>business card</h2>
            <p>Having never designed a business card before, not even a mock-up one, I needed to be sure I could extend my brands style onto just 84mm by 55mm of paper.</p>
        </div>

        <article class="_skill">
            <h3>contents</h3>
            <p>I wrote what would actually be on the card, including: logo, contact details, other text/message. I came across this article on 99designs - <a href="https://99designs.co.uk/blog/tips-en-gb/7-steps-to-designing-a-print-ready-business-card/">7 business card design tips that will rock your brand</a>, which opens with “First impressions last”. For many people, a business card will be the first exposure to your brand. So here’s what I learned from the article… <br><br><i>(note I haven’t talked about everything in the article, as that would be a lot to say)</i></p>
            <h4>the concept</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It’s important to understand what the purpose of the business card is, and who it is targeted for, in my case this is potential employers and/or clients. A bit of a no brainer was to match my existing branding guidelines, using same fonts, colours and other styling including spacing and positioning. The article also mentions how a creative brand should reflect its characteristics, with more freedom to content and design compared to usual businesses.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>the specs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Starting with the size of the card, I’ll be sticking to the more common 84mm x 55mm option, as other shapes are bound to be more expensive.</li>
                <li>As for the orientation, which can be overlooked by many, even myself. I will create an experimental portrait version of my business card, like I did with my CV, to see if there is any potential. Although a noted downside of portraits is that they’re harder to read than the more common landscapes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>right information in the right places</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple put, include the vital contact information on the front. The info listed to include follows: name, a job title/ tagline, contact info (email and phone minimum), website and logo are also included. As for the back, a larger version of the logo can be used and/or a good piece of imagery that has a flare.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>design inspo</h3>
            <p>I looked for business card designs on Pinterest for some initial research, here’s a selection what caught my eye. Many of the cards have logos positioned in the upper left corner, which matches my style guidelines, and contain minimal content, also inline with my guidelines for the brand. Currently plan to experiment using imagery on the back, possibly with the logo again, or a new variation of it.</p>

            <h4>why moo?</h4>
            <p>Good pricing, easy to shop options available and find information you need. From the article on 99designs, I knew I would be using the common sizing of 84mm x 55mm, labelled the ‘MOO’ size, at 50 cards from £13.19. Then onto paper quality, with four choices available. I would be going with the popular original, mainly for budget reasoning, but still had choices on the finish and corner type. The finishes on offer are matte and gloss, I made my mind on matte as this would best compliment my colour scheme and overall would be a better reflection of my brand. With corners set at square, although if there were the option to have rounded corners that was closer to a square finish, I would have considered this as images used in the brand have slightly rounded corners. Moo also offers a variety pack, which allows different designs on each card for no extra cost. Depending on my choices for the back of my card, this may be something to consider later on.</p>

            <p>As a web designer, the portfolio will be demonstration of my skillset alone, so everything has to be just right. Like the CV, I don’t want to bloat the site with too much content, particularly text. <br><br>Take a look at how I took an existing portfolio with poor design and lack of thoughtful content - both of which failed to demonstrate my skillset, and learn through great research and patience how to produce a perfected portfolio site which demonstrates the execution style of the brand with excellence.</p>

            <h3>existing branding</h3>
            <p>Prior to this project, I had a previous portfolio that was very basic made with four pages; home, about, portfolio and contact. The site wasn’t designed very well and no research was undertaken before designing in Adobe Photoshop, and I wasn’t truly happy with the final result, nor the content within. I place the poor design and lack of content down to the skipped initial planning and research into creating a killer portfolio.<br><br>Moving forward, I knew that this time round, I would need to put in the graft on planning exactly what I want the portfolio to achieve, its purpose and the opinion it will create in the user of the brand.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="_research">
            <h3>research</h3>
            <p>(Note: this research was conducted at the very start of the project, before any work on the CV or business card began. As I wanted to establish branding guidelines first, the guidelines are not just about visual design, but style of both content and language)<br><br>I researched what should be included in a portfolio, and what shouldn’t… The style of portfolios, such as using one-page designs and the effect they have, as well as how content is written and presented.</p>
            <p>Here are some articles I found in my research that helped me craft my portfolio design and content:<br><br>Treehouse - <a href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/5-tips-creating-perfect-web-design-portfolio" target="_blank">5 Tips Creating Perfect Web Design Portfolio</a><br><br>Smashing Magazine - <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/the-roadmap-to-becoming-a-professional-freelance-web-designer/" target="_blank">The Roadmap To Becoming A Professional Freelance Web Designer</a></p>

            <p>With an improved understanding of what goes into a great portfolio and branding myself as a whole, I began to search for inspiration on sites such as Pinterest.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="assets/docs/portfolio/inspo.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>As from some of the examples found, I began to find patterns in all the designs. This included full width hero sections on homepages, excellent typography and many make use of case studies. The inspiration I collected provided the necessary insight into not only the design of the portfolio. but also written style of the content. Some articles read also stated how the written aspect of the portfolio is just as crucial as the actual design and usability of the portfolio itself.<br><br>Something that I didn’t like from the research was a common theme, which was use of very sophisticated effects or animations. On some sites this worked very well, and others it just seemed too much. What’s the purpose of incorporating all this magic? Well, it’s a clever way to demonstrate what you’re capable of, and where your skills stack up. For me, I will be going down a more subtle route. Featured will be parallax scrolling, using my own code, not parallax.js as it’s too bloated for my liking. I prefer to spend more time on the actual content and layout throughout the page, done so with absolute perfection.</p>

            <p>So, from the research completed on the project, the following was added to my branding guidelines:</p>
            <h4>in terms of content</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Less is more;</b> I was to be very critical of myself when producing the content for the site, crediting the value of every word used. With the exception of the case studies, which needed to be in-depth, the main page of the site is not word heavy. The user founds out enough that they should need to know about me without knowing too much, and this is done on purpose. Just like the CV, which also is very sparse on words, creates an invitation to the prospective client or employer to find out more about me.</li>
                <li><b>Professional, but not serious;</b> this was very important to me. As I need to convey a very professional persona about myself but at the same time I do not want to bore the user to death with my site. The way that the atmosphere of the site is set is done subtly, but well. It is literally as simple as words used, so if I were to use the phrase X, could be rewritten as X.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>in terms of design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>3-column layout;</b> my previous previous site used a 3-column grid, then I went to 2-columns, but here I am back working in 3’s (but better). The columns will be well defined, yet compliment the design effortlessly as the user follows down the site</li>
                <li><b>Readability;</b> this one’s inline with less is more, but in terms of the design and structure of the site as a whole. It’s also very easily overlooked in a design, but should be well considered during the design phase of a project. How quickly could the user get through the site and not miss anything important? And equally as important, how easily can the user do this? It’s all about making life easy and painless for the user whilst on the site, they might not consciously think ‘<i>wow that site was so easy to read</i>’, but they won’t have any negative thoughts.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="_design">
            <h3>design</h3>
            <p>Entering the design phrase, I wanted something similar to my existing branding style, yet something that would stand out and be rememberable, but nothing quirky or over-designed. This was the issue I was faced with when starting out, all I was set on was a 3-column design with navigation links separately positioned to the left in a less-common vertical list. I was also set on a one-page design, but was also planning on experimenting with one or two separate pages, such as a web-based CV, and some form of blog or ‘behind the scenes’ page.</p>

            <h3>development</h3>
            <p>I knew from the outset, even before I began designing, that this would be a highly experimental build not shy of issues and unexpected bugs. While the overall design is very clean and minimal in terms of content, there would be some JavaScript trickery behind the scenes making it all more immersive. The majority of this trickery would come in the form of the parallax scrolling effect. I had never created this effect with JavaScript before, I had only learnt it for this project, so the whole thing would be a learning curve from the outset.</p>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p>Taking a look at some components of the styling behind the portfolio. I use <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, a pre-processor that extends the functionality of vanilla CSS. First lets look at how Sass helps set the layout.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre><code>@mixin col( $value, $float: left ) {

    @if $value == 1 {
        $value: 3;

    } @else if $value == 2 {
        $value: 1.5 ;

    } @else {
        $value: 1;

    }

    width: percentage( 1 / $value ) !important;

    padding: 0 2rem;
    float: $float;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>The grid system is built as an on-demand component, so it's only used when called, as demostrated here in one of the classes that's used to style articles on the project and progression pages <i>(as well as this docs)</i>.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre><code>._1 {
    h3 {
        @include col( 1 );
    }

    p {
        @include col( 2 );
    }

    .image, .code {
        @include col( 3 );
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>And finally here's the output CSS found in the production stylesheet</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre><code>@media screen and (min-width: 767px) {
  ._1 h3 {
    width: 33.3333333333% !important;
    padding: 0 2rem;

  ._1 p {
    width: 66.6666666667% !important;

    width: 100% !important;
    padding: 0 2rem;
    float: left; }</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>If you noticed the class name <b>._1</b> and thought how do you know how will that look, well I created a reference list so I know what article style to use for certain content. For example, the summary section in a project case study uses article 3</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="assets/docs/portfolio/reference.jpg">
            </div>
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>Onto the magic, jQuery, a library for JavaScript, is used to make this site possible and work the way it does. On particular key feature is the parallax scrolling effect. The effect you see as when you scroll, some content appears to move at a different speed, or even direction! In fact, content can be altered in almost any way with this effect.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre><code>function parallax() {

        var stage = $( window ),
            scrollTop = window.pageYOffset,
            scrollOpa,

            bg = $( '.hero-background' ),
            bg_speed = 4,
            bg_appr = bg.css('opacity'),

            about = $( '#about_bg' );


        stage.on( 'scroll resize', function() {

            scrollTop = window.pageYOffset,
            scrollOpa = scrollTop / 100;

            var b = bg_appr - scrollOpa / 24;
            bg.css({ 'opacity': b });

            if ( width <= 767 ) {

                var c = -80 + scrollTop / 12;
                about.css({ 
                    'top': c
                });
            } else if ( width > 767 ) {
                var c = -100 + scrollTop / 12;
                about.css({ 
                    'top': c
                });
            }

        });

        stage.trigger( 'scroll' );
    };
    parallax();</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>JavaScript is used to control a vast number of features on the site, many of which are present on this docs page. Some include, navigation tracker, content fading in nicely on page load. It is also used to determine the width of the device being used, which can alter the behaviour of certain elements, such as how the navigation responds and the positioning of the main hero contents</p>
            <h4>issues</h4>
            <p>I'd be lying if I said nothing went wrong or everything went as expected, because that couldn't be further from the truth. Here's some of the hickups..</p>
            <p>Regarding the project case studies and progression pages, I needed to work out the best way to structure and style the individual sections. Shown here is a sample from the designs of the brief section in a case study. What seemed a relatively straight forward thing to do, was actually difficult to create as it needed to be versatile.<br><br>A bug in early development of the main portfolio page, which was being caused my a parallax image in the about section, resulted in all content on the page being un-selectable. Even when removing the image to test this theory, while elements could then be selected, there was still some areas that could not be selected. The issue was resolved by organising the z-index property of the parallax elements and the sections of the page themselves.</p>

            <p>This stage is for examining the first complete draft that is published live for testing on various devices to scout any bugs that will ironing out before full release. The other half of testing is based on user experience, letting people experience the site and see how they get on using it.</p>
            <p>How long does it take them to read the portfolio page? Did they click that link, or scroll right to the bottom? Did they understand how the navigation worked? Was the content easy to read and follow? Did the case studies feel like a story? Was the progression page interesting? Did they like the web-based CV? What did they think about how the site looked, the way the site scrolled (parallax effect)?<br><br>All these questions will be used to determine of any changes need to be made to the design, style of language used, aspect ratio of images, the speed of animations ect. Once cross-browser testing and user experience testing is complete, the final version will be published live to the domain.</p>
